# AVWAP NIFTY F&O Option-Selling System — Project Overview

**Status:** v2026-09-17a · Python 3.10+ · ~7,000 lines of Python (≈5,400 core runtime, ≈1,600 tests + ops tools) plus ~49 KB of hand-rolled dashboard JavaScript · 72 automated tests, all passing · running in **PAPER** mode (real Dhan market data, no live orders)

---

## 1. What this system is

An automated, rule-based **option-selling** trading system for NSE F&O markets, built on the **DhanHQ v2 API** with a real-time web dashboard. It sells short-dated option contracts (CE and PE) around ATM when a completed 15-minute candle crosses **below a per-contract Anchored VWAP (AVWAP)**, and buys them back when a candle closes **above** that AVWAP.

Core design principles:

- **Faithful, minimal strategy** — exactly the specified rules, no extra indicators, filters, or "improvements". The first objective is faithful implementation; the second is paper observation.
- **PAPER mode is the default.** Live trading is opt-in, requires explicit double confirmation, and is gated behind a 12-point checklist.
- **Real data, real semantics** — live Dhan quotes, candles, option chains and (in live mode) real order/fill data. Fills are never assumed; every state transition SIGNAL → ORDER SENT → ACCEPTED → FILLED/REJECTED is recorded.
- **Resilience by construction** — per-instrument error isolation (one bad stock can't stop the others), loud failures (the app aborts rather than run blind on empty data), and full persistence so restarts never lose positions or AVWAP state.

---

## 2. The strategy (exact rules)

### 2.1 Instruments
- **Sell-to-open only** (short options). The only buy is a **buy-to-close** of an existing short.
- Universe: a **curated list of ~67 highly liquid NSE F&O stocks** plus **NIFTY** and **BANKNIFTY** index options.
- **Expiry legs per underlying:**
  - NIFTY: **current + next weekly expiry** (two legs)
  - BANKNIFTY and all stocks: **monthly expiry**, with the standard premium-preservation switch on the **24th** of the month
  - Expiry dates always come from the exchange/Dhan (live expiry lists), never assumed.

### 2.2 Scanner universe (what is monitored)
- Per underlying, per expiry leg: **ATM + 4 ITM strikes on each side** (configurable via `strategy.itm_strikes_per_side`).
  - 9 unique strikes, **10 monitored contracts** (ATM contributes both a CE and a PE).
  - Cheaper stocks have finer strike grids, pricier stocks coarser — the window is always computed from that leg's **real chain strikes**, never an assumed step.
- **ATM tracking follows the underlying's live price**, never option LTPs:
  - Stocks: NSE equity LTP via the quote API, 30 s cadence
  - Indices: option-chain spot, 30 s cadence (shared 3 s pacing)
- **Existing open positions keep being monitored** even after they fall outside the ATM±4 window (position universe is a permanent union).

### 2.3 Entry (short)
A **true cross below AVWAP on completed 15-minute candles only** (no intracandle evaluation):

```
prev_close >= prev_avwap  AND  current_close < current_avwap   →  SELL (open short)
```

- Already-below-AVWAP is **not** an entry; re-entry after an exit requires a **fresh** cross.
- Duplicate protection: each signal is persisted with a unique key `(security_id, candle_ts, action)` — re-delivered candles (reconnect, retry, restart) can never produce a second signal.

### 2.4 Exit (buy-to-close)

```
current_close > current_avwap   →  BUY TO CLOSE
```

- **No fixed stop-loss, no other indicator, no time-of-day rules.** One rule in, one rule out.

### 2.5 Risk limits (configurable, enforced before any entry)
`risk.quantity_per_trade`, `risk.max_open_positions`, `risk.max_trades_per_day`, `risk.max_daily_loss` — the risk module vetoes entries that would breach any limit.

---

## 3. The AVWAP engine (the heart of the system)

- **Per-contract state** — every option contract has its own cumulative AVWAP; there is no shared cumulative state across strikes/expiries/underlyings.
- **Anchor** = the **first tradable 15-minute candle of that specific contract** (monthly series list at the start of the month; weeklies when listed).
- **Cumulative across days** — never reset at day, week, or month boundaries; the only reset event is a contract's own creation/expiry.
- **Price convention:** typical price `(High + Low + Close) / 3` on volume-weighted 15-min candles.
- **Anchor integrity is monitored end-to-end:**
  - History fetches are **paced (1.0 s)** with **4 retries** to survive Dhan rate-limit (429) storms.
  - If the month-start window can't be served, the app logs a loud ERROR, falls back to a shorter window, and raises a **permanent PARTIAL flag** (`avwap_partial_history`) shown in red on the dashboard ("AVWAP since" column).
  - Ops tools validate and repair late anchors: `tools/check_avwap.py` (read-only audit, compares stored vs freshly-fetched VWAP) and `tools/reanchor_avwap.py` (delete + full rebuild, `--all`/`--dry`).
- **Restart-safe:** anchor, cumulative value, and last-processed candle are persisted; already-consumed candles are never counted twice.

**Main loop (per tick, ~1 s):** process newly closed 15-min windows (each candle **persisted to the DB** as it is consumed) → engine evaluates rules → refresh universe/ATM (30 s cadence) → poll LTP + underlying spots (30 s cadence) → poll live order fills (3 s, live mode) → sync position universe. Every step is wrapped so one instrument's failure can't take down the loop; every outbound Dhan REST call updates the telemetry counters shown on the System Health page (requests, 429s, errors by path, last latency).

### Module map

| Path | Lines | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `main.py` | 143 | Entry point. PAPER/LIVE gating (LIVE needs `trading_mode=LIVE` **and** `--i-understand-live`), `DHAN_CLIENT_ID`/`DHAN_ACCESS_TOKEN` env overrides, `--demo` mock mode. |
| `app.py` | 1590 | `TraderApp`: bootstrap (instrument master → per-underlying chains → AVWAP init), main loop, LTP/spot polling, universe refresh, position syncing, **per-candle persistence**, **REST telemetry**, dashboard payload builders (state / contract / journal), control actions (close-position, schedule-rebuild), fail-fast auth abort. |
| `strategy/rules.py` | 39 | **The only strategy rules** — entry cross + exit close. Nothing else may be added without an explicit strategy revision. |
| `strategy/avwap.py` | 156 | AVWAP accumulator: anchor, typical-price weighting, persistence, PARTIAL-history flags. |
| `strategy/engine.py` | 174 | `SignalEngine`: per-candle rule evaluation, signal dedup, dashboard status, last-signal tracking. |
| `market/universe.py` | 284 | Per-underlying, per-expiry-leg universe: ATM detection from real chain strikes, CE/PE ±4-ITM windows, scanner + position contract sets, ATM re-tracking. |
| `market/candles.py` | 172 | 15-min candle windowing (session-aware IST windows, boundary grace). |
| `dhan/client.py` | 141 | REST client: auth headers (`access-token`, `client-id`), JSON, retries with backoff on 429/5xx, typed `DhanAPIError`. |
| `dhan/market_data.py` | 218 | Quote API (batches ≤1000 ids, NSE_FNO / NSE_EQ) and intraday 15-min candles (5-yr depth) with pacing + retries. |
| `dhan/option_chain.py` | 164 | Option chain + expiry list clients with a **shared 3 s pacer** (Dhan limit: 1 req/3 s). |
| `dhan/feed.py` | 406 | `DhanCandlePollFeed` (production candle source: history fetch, closed-candle fetch, LTP poll) and `MockFeed` (deterministic synthetic market for `--demo` and tests). |
| `dhan/instruments.py` | 343 | Dhan scrip-master download/cache (12 h TTL): contract lookup, lot sizes, tick sizes, underlying IDs, F&O universe extraction (stocks + indices). |
| `dhan/orders.py` | 119 | Live order placement/status/positions (order polling, fill detection). |
| `execution/broker.py` | 44 | `Broker` ABC — the paper/live seam. Strategy logic is identical in both; only this layer differs. |
| `execution/paper.py` | 148 | Paper broker: fills against live LTP with configurable slippage (bps), order lifecycle, position book. |
| `execution/live.py` | 359 | Dhan live broker: limit orders with tick offset, order-status polling (SIGNAL→SENT→ACCEPTED→FILLED/REJECTED), startup **reconciliation** (DB ↔ Dhan positions, both directions). |
| `portfolio/positions.py` | 132 | Position lifecycle + persistence (open/close, status transitions, restart restore). |
| `portfolio/risk.py` | 89 | Pre-entry risk vetoes (max positions, trades/day, daily loss). |
| `portfolio/pnl.py` | 22 | Realized/unrealized P&L. |
| `storage/database.py` | 440 | SQLite (WAL): positions, signals (dedup keys), AVWAP state (+schema migrations), **persisted 15-min candles (system of record for the chart + AVWAP rebuilds)**, kv store, candle-processed markers. |
| `storage/journal.py` | 49 | Append-only audit journal (every signal, order, fill, reconcile, manual control action, structured startup timeline). |
| `common/models.py` | 129 | Dataclasses: `Candle`, `OptionContract`, `Quote`, `Signal`, action constants. |
| `common/utils.py` | 144 | IST time handling (ZoneInfo with fixed UTC+05:30 fallback for Windows), session state (PRE_OPEN/OPEN/CLOSED), candle-window math, logging setup. |
| `common/config.py` | 131 | Config loader + `cfg_get` dotted-path access. |
| `dashboard/app.py` | 1281 | Flask dashboard (port 8000) + ~49 KB embedded vanilla JS. **12 pages** across two zones: *Live Trading* (Overview/Command Center, Scanner, Contract detail with canvas candlestick+AVWAP chart, Position Command Center, Signal Center with full explainability chain, Orders with raw Dhan responses) and *Data + Operations* (Data Health, System Health, Alert Center, Journal with filters + CSV/JSON export, Restart/Recovery, read-only Settings). REST: `/api/state`, `/api/contract/<sec>`, `/api/journal`, `/api/control` (gated by `dashboard.control_token`; actions: pause/resume, emergency stop/release, exit-all, **close-position**, **schedule-avwap-rebuild**). No CDN, no framework, no WebSocket. |
| `tools/check_avwap.py` | — | **Read-only AVWAP auditor**: lists anchor dates + PARTIAL flags; deep-dive per symbol (fresh full-history VWAP vs stored, 5-day-fallback simulation, diagnosis). |
| `tools/reanchor_avwap.py` | — | AVWAP repair: delete + full rebuild for late-anchored contracts (`--all`, symbol filter, `--dry`). |
| `tools/export_to_csv.py` / `fix_position_times.py` | — | Data export / maintenance utilities. |
| `tests/` | 1,300+ | **72 tests**: AVWAP math, candle windowing, engine signal logic + dedup, universe/ATM (incl. multi-expiry & index legs), risk vetoes, paper fills, **restart recovery**, universe filtering, plus V2: candle persistence (direct + full main-loop path), REST telemetry (429 retry, error counters), journal filters, manual close, rebuild queue, dashboard payload shapes, contract/journal endpoints + control auth. |

## 5. Data & persistence

- **Database:** `data/trader.db` (SQLite, WAL mode) — the single source of truth:
  - `positions` — every order/position with full lifecycle
  - `signals` — deduplicated signal records (restart/reconnect safe)
  - `avwap_state` — per-contract anchor, cumulative AVWAP, last candle, PARTIAL flag
  - `candles` — **every processed 15-min candle, persisted at ingest** (the system of record for the contract chart and for AVWAP rebuilds — a chart is never drawn from in-memory state alone)
  - `journal` — append-only audit trail
  - `kv` — flags and markers (e.g. `avwap_partial_history`, the rebuild queue)
- **Instrument cache:** `data/instruments/` — Dhan scrip master (34.6 MB, 12 h TTL).
- **Restart semantics:** positions, AVWAP state, and journal all survive stop/start; the app re-attaches open positions to the monitoring universe on bootstrap ("restoring open positions" is step one) and resumes AVWAPs without double-counting candles.

## 6. Dhan API integration

| Endpoint | Use | Limits respected |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /v2/optionchain/expirylist` | Expiry legs per underlying | shared 3 s pacer |
| `POST /v2/optionchain` | Chain strikes + **index spot** + per-strike quotes | shared 3 s pacer |
| `POST /v2/marketfeed/quote` | LTP for ≤1000 option contracts (NSE_FNO) + stock spots (NSE_EQ) | 1 req/s, 1000 ids/req |
| Intraday candles (v2 historical) | 15-min history back **5 years** — AVWAP anchoring | 1.0 s pacing between history requests, 4 retries |
| Scrip master CSV | Contract/lot/tick/underlying reference | cached 12 h |
| Orders/positions endpoints | Live mode: place, poll, reconcile | 3 s fill polling |

- **Auth:** JWT access tokens are short-lived (days). The app **fails fast** on a 401 with an actionable message (generate new token → config or env var) instead of marching through the universe on failures, and **aborts bootstrap entirely** if every underlying fails (no running blind).
- **Credentials:** `config/config.json` (`dhan.client_id` / `dhan.access_token`) or `DHAN_CLIENT_ID` / `DHAN_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variables.

## 7. Safety model

1. **PAPER is the default** (`trading_mode: PAPER`). Strategy logic is byte-identical in paper and live — only the execution layer differs (`execution/paper.py` vs `execution/live.py`).
2. **LIVE requires double confirmation:** `trading_mode=LIVE` in config **and** `--i-understand-live` (or `AVWAP_LIVE_CONFIRM=<phrase>`), followed by a printed 12-point checklist.
3. **Live reconciliation on startup** (live mode): DB rows Dhan no longer holds → marked `CLOSED/RECONCILED`; shorts Dhan holds that the app doesn't know about → adopted.
4. **Error isolation per instrument** — one failing stock never stops the rest; the main loop logs and continues.
5. **Loud failures** — bootstrap aborts on total data failure; auth failures abort immediately; partial AVWAP history is permanently flagged and visible, never silent.
6. **Audit everything** — journal records signals, orders, fills, reconciliations, **manual dashboard control actions**, and the **structured startup timeline** (every bootstrap step, timestamped — the Restart/Recovery page renders it directly).
7. **Dashboard safety controls** — mode is always displayed (LIVE in red); pause/resume, emergency stop/release, and EXIT ALL (type-to-confirm) are the only runtime actions, all token-gated; strategy/risk/mode values can only be changed by editing the config file and restarting.

## 8. Dashboard (Flask, `http://localhost:8000`)

12 pages in two zones — **LIVE TRADING** and **DATA + OPERATIONS** — plus a persistent header (mode banner, market session, engine status, build). Single page, hash-free client-side navigation; state polled every 3 s; hand-rolled canvas charts, no CDN, no framework, no WebSocket.

**LIVE TRADING**
- **Overview / Command Center** — today's P&L, open positions x/max, signals today, orders today, wins/losses, exposure, unrealized; market-status bar with session timeline + NIFTY/BANKNIFTY spots; system strip (last candle, next candle close, feed, DB, uptime).
- **Scanner** — every monitored contract: symbol/option, expiry + DTE, strike, CE/PE, LTP, last close, AVWAP, **AVWAP since** (red when history was partial), Δ vs AVWAP, trigger, volume, OI, last candle, status (WATCH/ENTRY/EXIT/OPEN/PENDING). Text filter + quick views (ALL / ACTIONABLE / OPEN / EXIT CANDIDATES / PARTIAL) + CE/PE + above/below-AVWAP filters; per-row ERROR state; row click → contract page.
- **Contract detail** — hand-rolled canvas candlestick chart with the AVWAP line, entry/exit markers and the AVWAP anchor marker (data = persisted candles); per-contract stats (AVWAP, typical price, Δ, volume, OI, anchor date, partial warning); the per-contract signal history with explainability; if a position is open → position card with **[CLOSE POSITION]**; if history was partial → **[SCHEDULE REBUILD]**.
- **Position Command Center** — portfolio totals (exposure, unrealized, realized today/all-time) + one card per open position (entry, current, P&L, duration, AVWAP, contract link, per-position **[CLOSE]**).
- **Signal Center** — signals as permanent events with the full **candle → signal → order → position** chain and explainability (which rule line fired, which risk checks passed/would veto).
- **Orders** — status table (SIGNAL → SENT → ACCEPTED → FILLED/REJECTED) with the **raw Dhan response** per order (expandable).

**DATA + OPERATIONS**
- **Data Health** — per-feed status (LTP / option chain / candles / master / REST) with last-ok, latency, error counts; AVWAP integrity summary (complete / partial / failed); the partial contracts with **[SCHEDULE REBUILD]** (queued in kv, applied at next start — never under the live engine).
- **System Health** — component status (engine, strategy, execution, database, dashboard), REST API stats (requests, 429s, errors by path), process CPU/RAM (optional `psutil`), heartbeats (engine, last candle, next close, polls, uptime).
- **Alert / Incident Center** — currently-computed alerts with severities + incident history derived from the journal.
- **Journal** — filterable by event / symbol / severity, full detail per row, **CSV and JSON export**.
- **Restart / Recovery** — structured, timestamped startup timeline (every bootstrap step with status), current recovery state.
- **Settings** — **read-only** display of the effective config; only a small safe subset is changeable at runtime (pause/resume, emergency stop, exit-all). Strategy/risk/execution/mode changes = edit `config/config.json` + restart (hard rule — the UI never edits strategy or risk values).

**Safety controls:** the header always shows the trading mode (LIVE in red); pause/resume entries, emergency stop/release, and EXIT ALL (type-to-confirm) are available from the header controls; every control action is token-gated (`dashboard.control_token`) and journaled.

## 9. Operations

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt        # requests, Flask, psutil, tzdata(Windows); pytest for dev
# put Dhan client_id + access_token in config/config.json
# (or set DHAN_CLIENT_ID / DHAN_ACCESS_TOKEN env vars)

python main.py                          # PAPER trading on live Dhan data
python main.py --demo                   # synthetic mock data (no Dhan needed)
python main.py --mode LIVE --i-understand-live   # live (after the checklist!)
```

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Audit AVWAP health (read-only) | `python tools\check_avwap.py` (or `… BAJFINANCE 970`, `--security <id>`) |
| Repair late-anchored AVWAPs | `python tools\reanchor_avwap.py --all` (or symbol filter, `--dry`) |
| Export data | `python tools\export_to_csv.py` |

**Runbook:** app may be stopped at any time (typical: post-market) and restarted pre-market — positions, AVWAP state, and journal persist in `data/`. Dhan tokens expire every few days: on a 401, generate a new token at dhan.co (Manage Access Token) and update config/env, then restart.

## 10. Testing & current status

- **72 automated tests**, all green: AVWAP math & anchoring, candle windowing, signal rules + dedup, universe construction (multi-expiry, index legs, ATM re-tracking), risk vetoes, paper fills, restart recovery, plus the V2 dashboard layer (candle persistence, REST telemetry, journal filters, manual close, rebuild queue, payload shapes, contract/journal endpoints, control auth).
- **Dashboard render-verified:** the served page is loaded in a headless DOM (jsdom) against payloads generated from a real mock `TraderApp`; all 12 pages render with zero JavaScript errors, and the scanner/quick-view/contract/close-button interactions are exercised.
- **Validated live:** full-universe validation against real Dhan data; AVWAP anchoring verified against chart-anchored VWAPs (root cause of one divergence — silent 429-storm fallback to a late anchor — fixed with pacing, retries, and the permanent PARTIAL flag + repair tools).
- **Known open item:** LTP column occasionally shows "–" in the scanner — diagnostic logging for the quote poll was added in v2026-09-16l to pinpoint the cause.

*One line to remember: the system does exactly one thing — sell options when a completed 15-min candle crosses below that contract's cumulative AVWAP and buy them back when it closes above it — and spends the rest of its engineering effort making sure that one thing is computed correctly, survives restarts, and can never trade live without an explicit, deliberate decision.*
